# This properties file is used to configure the entire build. The purpose of
# this file is so that it is easy to drop it into a project and change a few
# of these settings and have a build run successfully.
#
# NOTE: You may still need to take a look at and edit `phpunit.xml.dist`.

# Directory Configuration

# The main location of all the projects source code, this should be the only
# property that you need to change. Code can live in the root directory or it
# can live inside of it's own directory.

# --- You shouldn't need to edit any of the below value ---

# Location of all executables, this is the location on the `bin-dir` that you
# have configured in `composer.json`. If you have not configured this in
# 1composer.json` the default is to put it in the `vendor` directory.
project.bindir=${project.basedir}/bin

# Build artifacts that can be reused or updated, they do not need to be deleted
# every build. These would include charts and images.

# Location of generated documentation such as API and code coverage
